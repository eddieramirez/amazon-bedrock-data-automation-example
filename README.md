# Bedrock Data Automation (BDA) Samples

Amazon Bedrock Data Automation is a GenAI-powered capability of Bedrock that streamlines the development of generative AI applications and automates workflows involving documents, images, audio, and videos. By leveraging Bedrock Data Automation, developers can reduce development time and effort, making it easier to build intelligent document processing, media analysis, and other multimodal data-centric automation solutions.

Bedrock Data Automation offers industry-leading accuracy at lower cost than alternative solutions, along with features such as visual grounding with confidence scores for explainability and built-in hallucination mitigation. This ensures trustworthy and accurate insights from unstructured, multi-modal data sources.

Bedrock Data Automation is also integrated with Bedrock Knowledge Bases, making it easier for developers to generate meaningful information from their unstructured multi-modal content to provide more relevant responses for retrieval augmented generation (RAG).
